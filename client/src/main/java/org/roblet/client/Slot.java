/**
 * This can be used to send {@link Roblet} instances,
 * organize communication with them and if needed terminate them.

<P>
    Be aware that there is no timeout when working with slots.
    There is only the notion of validity.
    A slot is valid as long it has not been {@link #close()}d
    or got invalid on server side.
    The latter can happen if e.g. the server restarts and thus trivially
    does not have the slot anymore reserved or decided for other reasons
    to remove the slot.
</P>
<P>
    The following example sends a roblet to the roblet server running
    at the local host.
    The local host is represented by {@code null} and easily can be replaced
    by e.g. {@code args[0]} to allow providing the server name and if needed
    port as a command line argument.
    In addition to simplify the class is used as roblet application and as
    roblet class - so starting (A) first locally as a normal Java application
    ({@code main(...)}),
    then (B) instantiating the roblet ({@code new Test()}),
    (C) sending that to the server ({@code slot. run (...)}) including waiting
    for a result,
    (D) executing the roblet in the server ({@code execute(...)}),
    (E) handing back a result ({@code return ...})
    and finally (F) printing the result to standard out.
</P>
